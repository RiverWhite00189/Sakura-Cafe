You’re going about a regular day going day to day trudging along trying to figure out what to do today, with your life. You look up and you’ve never seen this place on campus before. You glance at your watch, you have time. “I’ll check it out” you think to yourself. When you step inside you squint against a bright light and when you open your eyes you’re enveloped in soft pink light. “Wait, is it already sunset!?” You ask yourself, you’re about to turn away when you hear a voice. 
“Welcome, would you like to order?” 
You stop what do you say: 1. Wait, where am I? What is this?  2.What do you recommend?
- 1. Sit’s down and talks to you 
    - Wait you’re not from here? What were you planning to do today? 
        - You can’t leave until you’re ready to leave (When you’re ready to leave it’ll jump you to the notion) 
    - 1. I really didn’t know 2. I had a really good plan 
        - 1.   Oh, what type of day did you want to have?

        - 2. Fun day: Give idea’s about fun things to do. Chill at home, go out and have fun. 
            - Do you need to finish some tasks today? Ask for list.
        - 3. Productive day: What tasks do you need to do? Get a list (top three) 
            - Do something enjoyable today as well: Ask for one fun tasks
        - 2.  Tell me about the plan and you take in the multiple choice and give positive reinforcement 

You nodded your head, eyes glazing over as you pretend to understand their answer. What did she mean you can’t leave until you’re ready? But the sweet smells of the cafe and the warm feeling it incites in your chest prompts you to stay. You nod your head again a little more decisively, “I’ll take a vanilla cappuccino”  
“What’s that?” The barista furrows her brow. You open your mouth trying to explain, no words coming out as you’re confused, how does what clearly looks like a cafe not have a vanilla cappuccino. How does the barista not know? 
“Don’t worry,” she says after your silence, “I’ll help you,” she smiles warmly and you smile back. 


- 2. Take your order 
    - “Let’s see, hmm, do you like to wake up with something spicy or sweet?”
        - Spicy:
            - You like to jolt into action, and are fine being a little uncomfortable. Challenges spur you on. 
        - Sweet: 
            - You like to ease into things, like things that are comforting and like to go with the flow. 
    - Sparkles or no sparkles? She asks. What are sparkles, “Sparkles can give you a little extra energy!” I personally take at least three spoon of it in my drink. 
        - 1. You nod asking for sparkles, you need a little extra energy today to get through everything you gotta do?
            - You might benefit from a little bit more rest, water, and food. 
        - 2. You shake your head feeling just fine, or fine enough to do what ever you need to do.

        - Yes: You’re missing or looking for something 
        - No: You feel good today like you got your cards together

        - You need to gain clarity on what you’d like to do
(Gives you a little like benchmark / checkpoint on how you’re doing today. Let’s you reflect so you can figure out what to do) 

You go to sit at the table while the barista whips up your drink you look outside and the trailing cherry blossom and jasmine flowers that seem to just drop-off the roof and onto the window. You take a deep breath filling your lung with the sweet rejunivating smell. A feeling blossoms in your chest, a feeling of nostalgia for something you’ve never felt before. You also feel fur. Your eyes which had dropped closed without you noticing fly open. Fur! You look down sharply trying to identify, the fur. Just then a cat jump up onto the table. It purs as you scratch if behind the ears and under the chin. It rolls onto its belly and looks at you, demanding you pet it. You laugh and oblige. 
The cat meeting your eyes again and you hand comes to a stop as the eye contact feels unsettling. In a poof the cat turns into: 
    - A pot of gold 
    - Dust
    - Flowers 
    - Books 
    - Kitten 

The barista set’s down your drink with a smile, telling you to enjoy. You smile and raise your cup to take a sip. But, before it can pass your lips a bright light appears making you squint again. You’re back on campus, hands empty. “Huh, that’s what she meant.” You think to yourself, a soft but determined feeling in your chest now. “I wish I got to taste that drink, though.”
