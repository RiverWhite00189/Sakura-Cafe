## Inspiration
Many of our teammates have always struggled to "seize the day" in the sense that they wake up with a jumble of tasks in their heads, but no real way to organize them. Many of us found typical productivity apps to be "dry and repetitive" as well as disengaging and hard to stick with. Our team also enjoys narrative-focused games and stories, so we incorporated these elements into a cozy, low-stress cafe story game. 

## What it does
Players enter a world with a warm, welcoming cafe, and through their experience, they plan out tasks, reflect on themselves, and explore long-term desires.

## How we built it
Our team worked through 3 main components: story, design, and development. The story focused on making a whimsical environment with magical realism that would invite the user to interact with the world. Our design tried to capture some of the more magical quirks of the world with bright colors and an abstract style that leaves much to the viewer's interpretation. Our development used solely Python along with the pygame library to create some visual elements. 

## Challenges we ran into
It was the first time many of our team members had used Pygame, so working through that was one of the main challenges we faced. For all of our members, this was the first hackathon we have participated in, and as such, we faced challenges relating to organization, planning, and technical skills.  

## What's next for Cherry Blossom Cafe
Our team hopes to incorporate the user interaction and overall text components into the user interface rather than the console. At the same time, we hope to later connect this with Notion to take user input and provide a tangible output through a Notion task list/calendar function.
